# Process to set up.

1. Navigate to https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/ and download the stable release of Docker.

2. After the download finishes, open the Docker.dmg file and drag the application icon into the Applications folder.

3. Navigate to the Applications folder and open the Docker application. You will be asked for your password.

4. A pop-up window will open from the menu bar on your computer.  Once it displays 'Docker is now up and running!', you're ready!

5. Navigate to the folder that you cloned this repository into.  Run ```sh start_image.sh``` and let the application
take care of itself!

6. Open ```localhost:8000``` in your web browser and use the application!
